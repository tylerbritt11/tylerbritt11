# Hi, I'm Tyler 👋

PM who ships AI-powered products in industries most PMs won't touch: construction, real estate, and home maintenance.

I'm the sole PM at Paradigm, where I lead product strategy across ~20 engineers plus a dedicated AI team for a B2B SaaS platform that processes tens of thousands of construction blueprints each year. This GitHub is where I document real product decisions and AI-native workflows I'm using to ship products from idea to launch. Expect practical PM artifacts, not theory.

## What I Build

🏗️ **AI-Native B2B SaaS** — Embedding computer vision and generative AI into products for industries most PMs overlook, including construction and home maintenance.

🏠 **Proptech** — Building tools that make real estate operations and homeownership more intelligent, proactive, and data-driven.

💪 **Health & Wellness Tech** — Publishing research-backed recovery and performance content through Recovery Reviews, informed by hands-on experimentation.

## Current Projects

- 🔧 WellKept (private repo) — AI-powered home maintenance platform (concept → MVP, beta launch target: Q1 2026). Demo available on request.
- 💪 [Recovery Reviews](https://recovery-reviews.com) — Health & fitness blog

## Background

I started in construction operations, moved into an early-stage AI startup, and now lead product at scale in construction SaaS. At Newmetrix (acquired by Oracle), I led discovery and delivery for 13 industry-first computer vision safety models. At Paradigm, I own platform strategy and roadmap execution while partnering closely with AI teams to ship production-impacting CV capabilities.
